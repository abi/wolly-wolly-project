This is Gary Bradski's 10/19/11 multi-modal perception/version of linemod.  This is just a basic guide to use, it won't compile.
Below, I use the a color image to compute gradient linemod features and the same color image to compute the color features for filtering.

//MAIN FUNCTION (EXAMPLE WITH LOTS OF DEBUG IN IT)
My Main file is in MyMMod.cpp

//CLASSES ARE:
mmod_objects -- holds recognition results, it contains a map of modalities (color, depth, gradients ...) in
mmod_mode	 -- holds a features for a modality, it contains a map of features and offsets which are in
mmod_features -- holds a list of object views (vector<vector<uchar> >) of 8 bit binarized features and their offsets ... these are the model templates

mmod_general  -- Almost all the learning and matching computation and utility functions are here
mmod_color    -- Shouldn't be named "color", should be named mmod_calc_feature -- these classes, one for each feature take a modality as input 
                 (depth image, color image) and creates a feature image of 8 bit values. These take a mask (training) or not (test), see below.

//GET OUR IMAGES IN, AND REDUCE IF YOU WANT A SPEED UP:

	buildPyramid(ColorRaw0, ColorPyr, PYRLEVELS); //This is optional, you can just use the raw images. I had 1Kx1K images, so did this for speed.

//LEARN A FILTER TO CONFIRM RECOGNIZED OBJECTS IN TEST MODE
	int num_fs = filt.learn_a_template(colorfeat,Mask,"Tea",framenum);

. . . 

//EXAMPLE OF I/O -- I USE A FILTER IN THIS EXAMPLE, YOU CAN USE OBJECTS IN A SIMILAR WAY
	{ //Serialize out

   . . . Optionally, check the recognitions with a filter (here my trained color filter)
	filt.filter_object_recognitions(colorfeat,Objs,cthresh);

//USE THE RESULTS
	Objs.rv  		contains a vector of rectanglular bounding boxes of recognized objects
	Objs.ids 		contains the corrsponsing list of their names
	Objs.scores		contains their matching scores
	Objs.frame_nums	contains the frame number of the model, so that we can relate it to the view learned.

g.visualize_binary_image(gradfeat,Gvis); //DISPLAY COLOR CODED BINARY IMAGE
